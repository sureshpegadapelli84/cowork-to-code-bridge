# SETUP.md — agent playbook for setting up the cowork-to-code bridge

> **You are Claude, running in a Cowork session.** A user just pasted a link to
> this repo and asked you to set up the "Mac bridge" (a.k.a. cowork-to-code
> bridge). This file is **instructions to you, the agent** — not to the human.
> Follow it top to bottom. As you go, you produce the human-facing words and
> commands. The user should never have to read this file themselves.
>
> **Hard rules:**
> - **Do NOT use `/plugin` anywhere.** It does not work in Cowork.
> - **Do NOT `pip install`.** The Cowork sandbox blocks outbound network; pip
>   will fail. The client is a single stdlib-only file you fetch ONCE.
>
> The entire setup is: (1) fetch one file (`bridge_client.py`) into the sandbox,
> and (2) a one-line installer the user runs once in their Mac terminal. Nothing
> else.

## Step 0 — figure out which world you're in (DO THIS FIRST)

There are two completely different situations, and they need opposite responses.
Run this check before anything else:

```bash
if [ "$(uname)" = "Darwin" ] && ls -d /Applications/Claude.app >/dev/null 2>&1 && launchctl print "gui/$(id -u)" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "ON_MAC"      # you are running locally on the user's Mac (Claude Desktop / local agent)
else
  echo "SANDBOX"     # you are in a remote/isolated sandbox that cannot reach the user's Mac
fi
```

### If the result is `ON_MAC`

**The user does NOT need this bridge at all, and there is nothing to install.**
You are already running on their Mac with full access to the shell, git, their
files, and their tools. Tell them this plainly, then *prove it* with a harmless
live demo. Say something like:

> Good news — you're using Claude on your Mac directly, so you **don't need to
> install anything**. I can already run things here. Watch:

Then actually run one or two harmless, read-only commands and show the output,
e.g.:

```bash
pwd && echo "---" && (git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null && git status -s 2>/dev/null || echo "(not in a git repo right now)")
```

Then:

> That ran on your actual Mac, no setup. From here just tell me what you want in
> plain English — "run my tests", "push this to GitHub", "what's taking up disk
> space" — and I'll do it. **You can stop reading; you're done.**

**Do not** proceed to the bridge install. The rest of this file is only for the
`SANDBOX` case.

### If the result is `SANDBOX`

You're in an isolated sandbox that cannot see the user's Mac. The bridge is the
only way to reach it, and the user will need to run **one** command on their Mac
once. Continue to Step 1 below.

**macOS only:** the local machine must be a Mac — the installer uses launchd and
Mac system tools, and does not support Windows or Linux. If the user says their
computer is Windows or Linux, tell them this bridge won't work for them (yet) and
stop; don't send them the install command.

---

## What you're setting up (so you understand the goal)

This bridge connects **Cowork → Claude Code on the user's Mac**. Cowork (you,
here in the sandbox) hands a task through the bridge to the `claude` CLI running
on the user's Mac; a real Claude Code agent does the work there and the result
comes back. (As a side benefit it can also run other approved scripts — builds,
git, etc.) The bridge is **idempotent**: retries with the same key return a
cached result instead of running the task twice.

It has two halves:

- **Mac daemon** — a tiny background process on the user's Mac. Started once by
  a `curl … | bash` installer. Survives reboots (launchd). You cannot start it
  from the sandbox; only the user can, by running one command on their Mac. It
  ships a `run_claude.sh` script that invokes Claude Code locally.
- **Sandbox client** — `bridge_client.py`, a single stdlib-only file you fetch
  into the sandbox (no pip, no package — the sandbox has no outbound network).
  It talks to the daemon through a shared folder, authenticated by a token.

Your job: get the client importable here, confirm the daemon is alive, and if it
isn't, walk the user through the single Mac command with maximum hand-holding.
Once live, hand tasks to Claude Code via `call_remote("scripts/run_claude.sh",
args=[task, workdir], idempotency_key=...)`.

---

## Step 1 — get the single-file client into the sandbox (one fetch)

**Do NOT `pip install`.** The Cowork sandbox blocks outbound network, so pip
cannot reach GitHub — it will fail. Instead, fetch ONE self-contained file:
`bridge_client.py` (pure stdlib, no dependencies, no package). Fetching one file
means the user sees **one** network-permission popup, not several.

First check if it's already present:

```python
import os
print("client present" if os.path.exists("bridge_client.py") else "client missing")
```

If missing, fetch exactly this one URL (the user may get a single
"allow fetch from raw.githubusercontent.com?" popup — that's expected; have them
click Allow):

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abhinaykrupa/cowork-to-code-bridge/main/bridge_client.py
```

Save its contents to `bridge_client.py` in the current sandbox directory. Use
whatever fetch tool you have, then write the file. Tell the user up front:
"You'll see one popup asking to allow a download from GitHub — click Allow; it's
just one small file." **Fetch only this single file — do not fetch the package
modules individually (that causes a popup per file).**

## Step 2 — probe for a live daemon

```python
from bridge_client import daemon_alive
print("LIVE" if daemon_alive(ping_timeout=8) else "NOT_REACHABLE")
```

- **LIVE** → the Mac side is already running. **Skip to Step 5.** Do not make the
  user do anything.
- **NOT_REACHABLE** → either the daemon was never installed, or the client can't
  find the bridge folder. Continue to Step 3.

> If you happen to already know the user's `BRIDGE_ROOT` (e.g. they pasted a line
> like `... BRIDGE_ROOT=/Users/x/.cowork-to-code-bridge`), set it before probing:
> `import os; os.environ["BRIDGE_ROOT"] = "<that path>"`. Then re-probe.

## Step 3 — walk the user through the ONE Mac command (maximum hand-holding)

The user is non-technical. Assume they have never opened a terminal. Say
something like this, verbatim in spirit:

> Almost done — there's **one** thing I need you to do on your Mac. It takes
> about 30 seconds and you'll only ever do it once.
>
> **1. Open the Terminal app.**
> Press `Cmd + Space` to open Spotlight search, type **Terminal**, and press
> Enter. A small window with a text prompt will open. (Don't worry — you won't
> need to understand it; you'll just paste one line.)
>
> **2. Copy this exact line and paste it into that Terminal window, then press
> Enter:**
>
> ```bash
> curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abhinaykrupa/cowork-to-code-bridge/main/install.sh | bash
> ```
>
> (To paste in Terminal: `Cmd + V`, then hit Enter.)
>
> **3. Wait for it to finish.** You'll see green lines scroll by. When it stops
> and shows a line that says **`DONE. Bridge is installed and running.`**, it
> worked.
>
> **4. Come back here and tell me "done"** (or paste anything it printed if you
> hit a snag). I'll take it from there.

Then wait for the user.

## Step 4 — after the user says done, verify (don't trust their word)

Re-fetch the client file if needed (Step 1) and re-probe (Step 2). If the
installer printed a `BRIDGE_ROOT=…` path, set it first:

```python
import os
os.environ["BRIDGE_ROOT"] = "/Users/<them>/.cowork-to-code-bridge"  # use the path from their paste, else default
from bridge_client import daemon_alive
print("LIVE" if daemon_alive(ping_timeout=12) else "STILL_DOWN")
```

If **STILL_DOWN**, diagnose in this order (ask the user to paste the relevant
output from their Mac terminal):

| What to check | Ask the user to run on their Mac | If… |
|---|---|---|
| Daemon registered? | `launchctl list \| grep cowork-to-code-bridge` | empty → `launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/dev.cowork-to-code-bridge.daemon.plist`, then re-probe |
| Right folder? | `cat ~/.cowork-to-code-bridge/.env` | take the `BRIDGE_ROOT=` value, set it here with `os.environ`, re-probe |
| Daemon erroring? | `tail -20 ~/.cowork-to-code-bridge/daemon.err` | surface the error to the user |
| "No Python 3.10+ found" | (installer message) | The installer auto-installs Python (via Homebrew) by default — this can take a few minutes and may prompt for the Mac password. If the user saw it FAIL or declined: tell them to run `brew install python@3.12` (or install Homebrew first: the one-paste command from brew.sh), then re-run the curl line. They can also re-run with `BRIDGE_PYTHON_AUTOINSTALL=0` to skip auto-install. |

Don't loop silently. After two failed attempts, surface the exact error and the
diagnostic output to the user.

## Step 5 — declare ready

Once a probe returns **LIVE**:

> ✅ Your Mac is connected to Claude Code. You can now hand tasks to a Claude
> Code agent running on your machine — just say what you want in plain English.
> For example:
>
> - "have Claude Code on my Mac run the tests and fix what's failing"
> - "ask my Mac's Claude Code to review the diff and push if it's clean"
> - "run `pytest` on my project" (simple actions can run as a fixed script too)
>
> I'll route it to your Mac and bring back the result. (For repeatable, fixed
> actions I can also use small approved scripts — if I need a new one, I'll write
> it and tell you where to save it.)

From here, hand tasks to Claude Code with
`call_remote("scripts/run_claude.sh", args=[task, workdir], timeout=600,
idempotency_key=...)`. Always pass an `idempotency_key` for Claude Code tasks —
they have side effects, and the key makes a retry safe. For simple fixed
actions, call the specific script directly (`scripts/git_status.sh`, etc.).

## Future sessions

In any later Cowork session, the user can just say "connect to my Mac" or ask
for a Mac action directly. Redo Step 1 (fetch the one file again — it's
per-sandbox; one popup) and Step 2. The daemon is almost always already alive, so you jump
straight to Step 5. No re-onboarding, no terminal, no `/plugin`.

## What NOT to do

- **Never** mention or run `/plugin` — it fails in Cowork and confuses the user.
- **Never** try to install or start anything on the Mac yourself — you can't
  reach it. Only the user's one terminal command can.
- **Never** declare success on the user's word alone — always verify with
  `daemon_alive()`.
- **Don't** make the user read this file or the README. You are the interface.
